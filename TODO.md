# Protein Function Prediction

Project Description

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Todo

- [ ] Try to increase number of taxons to 128 and 256  
- [ ] Benchmark DeepGOPlus  
- [ ] Benchmark SPROF-GO  
- [ ] Benchmark DeepGO-SE  
- [ ] Test different percentiles  
- [ ] Test collapsing layers into each other, by dividing GO ID height by 2, 3, 4...  
- [ ] Test protein redundancy by adding proteins with no annotations to base models  
- [ ] Test GO ID redundancy between classifiers of same layer  

### In Progress

- [ ] Create input file with the interpro families of each protein
